# VRISC Project

`vrisc`is a 64-bit virtual CPU architecture, with a high
extensible.

## Inspiration

There are popular architectures like `x86`,`risc-v` or `arm`
and else. Though it's easy to find tutorials to learn them,
for a new-comer, they are still so hard to learn that a
new-comer might tends to give up.

Vrisc instruction set is more simplified, so that a new-learner
don't need to pay much attention to the complicated instruction
set and instruction behaviors but to computer theory.

Hope vrisc will help more new-learner.
